// 10. *Pick the odd one out* - Write a program to accept four numbers from user and print the odd one among them.
//     - Number can be odd among others in following scenario:
//       - if three numbers are equal, then the different one is odd one among them.
//       - if three number are even, then the different one is odd one among them.
//       - if three number are odd, then the different one is odd one among them.
//     - if all are different, even or odd, then print no number is odd one among them.
